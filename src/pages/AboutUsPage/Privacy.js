			<p>Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! It's OUR nausea. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. Friday night. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? </p>
			<p>There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself. Hop on? Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maebyâ€¦ it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Daddy horny, Michael. It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door. </p>
